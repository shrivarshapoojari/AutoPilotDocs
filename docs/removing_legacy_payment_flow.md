# Removing Legacy Payment Flow Documentation

## Introduction

This document outlines the process and steps taken to remove the legacy payment flow in our system, replacing it with a new, integrated payment system using Stripe. This migration is crucial for improving payment efficiency, reducing dependencies, and enhancing overall system robustness. The migration process is tracked by Jira ticket **MIG-101**, titled "Migrate legacy payment system to Stripe."

## Overview of Changes

The following key changes were implemented as part of this migration:

1. **Removed Outdated Integrations**: Specifically, the PayPal integration was deactivated and removed from the system.
2. **Introduced Stripe API**: The system now uses the Stripe API for all payment-related processes, ensuring a streamlined and secure transaction environment.
3. **Updated Core Modules**: The `payment_service.py` module was updated to align with the new payment flow, incorporating Stripe functionalities.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Removal of PayPal Integration

The PayPal integration was deemed outdated, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies. The removal process involved:

- **Revision of Configuration Files**: All references to PayPal APIs were removed from configuration files.
- **Legacy Code Refactoring**: Any code utilizing PayPal APIs was refactored to either utilize Stripe APIs or removed entirely.
- **Update Dependency Lists**: All library and module dependencies related to PayPal were removed from the project dependencies.

### 2. Integration of Stripe API

To enhance security and streamline transactions, the Stripe API was integrated into our system. Key activities included:

- **API Key Configuration**: Securely storing and managing Stripe API keys in the environment configuration.
- **Code Updates**: Modifying existing payment-handling functions to use Stripe endpoints and operations.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling for Stripe-related operations to ensure system stability.

### 3. Updating Core Modules

The `payment_service.py` module was a critical part of this migration. The updates included:

- **Function Replacement**: Rewriting functions to work with Stripe instead of PayPal.
- **Data Structures Adjustment**: Modifying data structures to align with Stripe's data models.
- **Documentation**: Ensuring all changes are well-documented for future maintenance and scalability.

## References

The migration process was supported by the following tasks documented in Slack:

- **Stripe Setup**: Request for comprehensive documentation of the Stripe setup to ensure easy onboarding and troubleshooting.
- **Old Documentation Removal**: Instructions to clear all old payment flow documents that reference the legacy PayPal system, ensuring no outdated information persists.

## Conclusion

The removal of the legacy payment flow and integration of Stripe represents a significant enhancement to our payment processing capabilities. This update paves the way for future improvements and ensures a smoother, more secure payment experience for our users.

## Future Steps

To ensure the continued success of this migration, the following steps are recommended:

- Regular review and updates of the Stripe integration documentation.
- Continuous monitoring of payment flow to identify and resolve any potential issues.
- Regular training sessions for the development team to familiarize them with the new payment system.

By following these steps, we can ensure the seamless operation of our new, improved payment system.
